# Overview

***Maximizing DeFi Yields through AI-Powered Strategy Management***

## The Challenge

DeFi offers immense potential but comes with significant complexity. While basic token staking is straightforward, implementing advanced yield strategies requires extensive knowledge, constant monitoring, and active management—creating barriers for both newcomers and experienced investors alike.

Maximizing Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) through sophisticated interactions with lending pools, vaults, and yield strategies remains a complex challenge. The process demands considerable time investment, technical expertise, and continuous market surveillance. Many users, even those familiar with traditional finance, struggle to fully leverage DeFi opportunities due to the ecosystem's technical complexity.
