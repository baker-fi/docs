# Overview

***Unlocking DeFi Yields with AI-Driven Vault Management***

## The Status Quo üìä

**DeFi** offers immense potential but comes with significant complexity. While basic token staking is straightforward, implementing advanced **yield strategies** requires extensive knowledge, constant monitoring, and active management‚Äîcreating barriers for both newcomers and experienced investors alike.

Maximizing **Annual Percentage Yields (APYs)** through sophisticated interactions with lending pools, vaults, protocols remains a complex challenge. The process demands considerable time investment, technical expertise, and continuous market surveillance.

Many users, even those familiar with **Traditional Finance** (*tradFI*), struggle to fully leverage DeFi opportunities due to the ecosystem's technical complexity.

## What is BakerFi? üßë‚Äçüç≥

**BakerFi** is a decentralized protocol that simplifies this journey by amplifying your yield potential through agent managed vaults. Our protocol automatically implements optimized strategies using AI-powered intelligence that continuously analyze **market conditions**, **risk profiles** and **external data** to maintain optimal position balancing in our sophisticated yield vaults.

Our smart contracts streamline the entire investment process, allowing users to grow their assets efficiently through a **single interaction**.

A **user** simply selects their desired investment amount and deposits their assets on our **automated vault**. Our vault agents handle the rest, executing sophisticated yield optimization strategies without requiring constant user intervention.
The withdrawal process is also automated, allowing users to easily withdraw their assets at any time.

Apart from these cutting edge automated vaults, we also enrich the user participation by providing incentives to all protocol participants making the protocol and easy choice for users to grow their assets and earn rewards.
