## BKR Incentive Program ðŸ”–

**Driving Growth and Engagement**

Our protocolâ€™s **Dual Incentive Program**, comprising **Vault Incentives** and **Staking Rewards**, is thoughtfully designed to promote sustained growth and cultivate long-term user engagement with the BakerFI ecosystem.

- **Baking Incentives**: Users earn **dBKR (ERC-20)** tokens by contributing TVL (Total Value Locked) to our vaults. Select vaults may offer boosted rewards during special promotional periods, incentivizing active participation. These ERC-20 tokens unlock valuable perks, including exclusive discounts on **BKR** purchases, while directly rewarding users for bolstering vault liquidity.
- **Staking Rewards**: By staking **BKR**, users can tap into the protocolâ€™s success, earning a share of revenue generated from both vault strategies and broader protocol activity. This mechanism provides a consistent and passive income stream, aligning usersâ€™ interests with the long-term growth and prosperity of BakerFI.

Together, these incentives create a dynamic **flywheel effect**: increased user participation and staking fuel protocol growth, which in turn generates greater rewards and deepens user commitment. This self-reinforcing cycle ensures that every participant shares in the protocolâ€™s success, fostering a thriving ecosystem built on engagement, loyalty, and mutual benefit.
