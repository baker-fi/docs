# BKR

## What is BKR? ðŸ¤”

**BKR** is the utility ERC-20 complaint token of the BakerFi protocol deployed on **Base** blockchain. It is used to vote on proposals and to participate in the decision-making process and the fuel to incentivize the community to participate in the protocol.

At **BakerFi**, we believe in the power of decentralized decision-making and the collective wisdom of our community. Our token model is designed to embody the principles of transparency, inclusivity, and efficiency, ensuring that every member of the **BakerFi** ecosystem has a voice and a stake in protocol operations. Central to our governance framework is the **BKR** voting power token, which also empowers our community members to participate in the decision-making process.

:::tip
**BKR** is more than a governance token, it is a token that allows users that provide liquidity to our vaults to receive rewards from the protocol revenue.

## Token Details

- **Token Name:** *BakerFi*
- **Symbol:** **BKR**
- **Total Supply:** 500M **BKR**
- **Base Address:** TODO

**BKR stakers** are rewarded with a percentage of the protocol's revenue as an additional emission during the staking process. This mechanism not only incentivizes users to stake their BKR tokens but also aligns their interests with the overall success of the BakerFi ecosystem.
By participating in staking, users contribute to the protocol's growth while earning a share of the revenue generated from various vault strategies and activities. This creates a sustainable model where stakers benefit directly from the protocol's performance.

## Governance

The **BKR** token also serves as the primary instrument for community-driven decision-making and consensus-building within our protocol. **BakerFi DAO** decides on BakerFiâ€™s key strategy parameters (e.g. fees, risk parameters) and executes BakerFi protocol upgrades to enhance the protocol operation or mitigate found vulnerabilities.

At the core of **BKR Governance Token** lies a robust governance model, empowering token holders with the ability to propose, debate, and vote on key **protocol upgrades**, **strategy parameter adjustments**, and **strategic decisions.** Through a transparent and decentralized governance framework, the community can collectively steer the direction of the protocol, ensuring its adaptability and resilience in the ever-evolving and fast-paced landscape of decentralized finance (DeFi).

## Incentives Engine ðŸ”–

**Driving Growth and Engagement**

Our protocolâ€™s **Dual Incentive Program**, comprising **Vault Incentives** and **Staking Rewards**, is thoughtfully designed to promote sustained growth and cultivate long-term user engagement with the BakerFI ecosystem.

- **Baking Incentives**: Users earn **dBKR (ERC-20)** tokens by contributing TVL (Total Value Locked) to our vaults. Select vaults may offer boosted rewards during special promotional periods, incentivizing active participation. These ERC-20 tokens unlock valuable perks, including exclusive discounts on **BKR** purchases, while directly rewarding users for bolstering vault liquidity.
- **Staking Rewards**: By staking **BKR**, users can tap into the protocolâ€™s success, earning a share of revenue generated from both vault strategies and broader protocol activity. This mechanism provides a consistent and passive income stream, aligning usersâ€™ interests with the long-term growth and prosperity of BakerFI.

Together, these incentives create a dynamic **flywheel effect**: increased user participation and staking fuel protocol growth, which in turn generates greater rewards and deepens user commitment. This self-reinforcing cycle ensures that every participant shares in the protocolâ€™s success, fostering a thriving ecosystem built on engagement, loyalty, and mutual benefit.
